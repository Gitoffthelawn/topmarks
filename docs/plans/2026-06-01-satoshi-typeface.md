# Satoshi as a display accent

> Use **Satoshi** — a geometric grotesque with personality — on the page's
> **display elements**: the big **clock** (its loudest moment), the **search
> pill**, and the **settings heading**. Body and UI text stay on the system sans
> for crispness at 13px. Cookie stays as the script accent.

**Status:** Built · **Date:** 2026-06-01 · **Scope:** shared · both stores

## What changes

1. Satoshi is applied to three **display** elements via a shared `--font-display` token: the **clock**, the **search pill** (`#search-input`), and the settings **heading** (`#settings-panel h2`). The system stack is the fallback (swap, no FOIT, no layout break if the font fails).
2. **Body and all other UI text** stay on the system sans — Satoshi did not read well as the workhorse at the 13px body size, and the accent gives the personality without that cost.
3. The **clock** sits at weight **500 (Medium)** — the initial 900 read too heavy — and gets a user-adjustable size (see the size-slider note below). This replaces the center-widget plan's “bold system sans”.
4. The **Cookie** script font is untouched — it stays on the `.bmc-link` / brand accent.
5. No visible typeface setting; scope is one line (the `--font-display` token) to widen or narrow later.

## Why / context

The page already self-hosts one bundled font (Cookie) the canonical way: a
`@font-face` in `newtab.css`, a `<link rel="preload">` in `newtab.html`, and a
recursive copy of `assets/fonts/` into each store's `dist/` at build time.
Satoshi rides the exact same rails — no new build machinery, no remote fetch
(which extension CSP forbids and which would leak a request per new tab).

Satoshi ships as a single **variable** file carrying the whole weight axis
(`300–900`), so whatever weight an accent lands on (the clock settled at `500`)
comes from that one file — the minimum footprint is literally one `.ttf`. The
other 12 family files that were pasted in have been removed.

## Approach

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `packages/shared/assets/fonts/Satoshi-Variable.ttf` _(new)_ | The single bundled Satoshi file (variable, `wght 300–900`, ~124 KB). Already in place; the 12 redundant static/italic files have been deleted. |
| `packages/shared/assets/newtab.css` | Add a `@font-face` for `"Satoshi"` pointing at the variable file with `font-weight: 300 900` and `font-display: swap`. Define a `--font-display` token (Satoshi + system fallback) and apply it to `#clock`, `#search-input`, and `#settings-panel h2`. Body stays system sans. Clock weight set to `500`. |
| `packages/shared/assets/newtab.html` | Add `<link rel="preload" href="fonts/Satoshi-Variable.ttf" as="font" type="font/ttf" crossorigin>` next to the existing Cookie preload — the clock is the default widget and shows above the fold, so warming the font avoids a swap flash on it. |
| `packages/chrome/build.ts`<br>`packages/firefox/build.ts` | Add `"fonts/Satoshi-Variable.ttf"` to each `REQUIRED_DIST_FILES` list so `validateDist()` fails loudly if it ever stops shipping. The recursive `fonts/` copy already carries the file into `dist/` — no copy-logic change needed. |

```
build copies assets/fonts/ → @font-face "Satoshi" (300–900) → preload warms it → --font-display token → applied to #clock (500), #search-input, #settings h2 · body stays system sans
```

## Verification

- `npm run build` both packages — `validateDist` confirms the font ships; type-check is unaffected.
- Load unpacked: the clock, search pill, and settings heading render in Satoshi; body/UI text is system sans; Cookie still on the brand link.
- Throttle/deny the font once → accents fall back to system sans cleanly (swap, no invisible text, no layout jump).
- Glass + Classic, light + dark, all legible over a wallpaper.

## Decisions

> **✓ Display accent, not the workhorse** — tried Satoshi on the whole UI; it didn't read as well as the system sans at the 13px body size. Scoped to display elements (clock, search pill, settings heading) via `--font-display` — personality where it counts, system crispness everywhere else.

> **✓ One variable file — the minimum** — `Satoshi-Variable.ttf` alone spans the whole weight axis the accents need. The 12 static + italic files were removed.

> **✓ Clock at weight 500** — 900 then 700 read too heavy; 500 (Medium) is the settled weight. Overrides the center-widget plan's “bold system sans” note.

> **✓ Keep Cookie** — the script accent on `.bmc-link` stays — Cookie the flourish, Satoshi the display face, system sans the body.

> **✓ Upright only, no italic file** — no display accent uses italic, so only the upright variable ships — no need for the ~130 KB variable-italic file.

> **✓ TTF, matching Cookie** — consistent with the existing self-hosted font and with what was provided. See the open item on woff2.

## Open items

> **? woff2 to shrink the payload** — the variable TTF is ~124 KB; the equivalent woff2 is typically ~40 KB. Fontshare publishes woff2, but it isn't reachable from this sandbox. Optional follow-up: drop in `Satoshi-Variable.woff2` and switch the `src` — smaller download, faster first paint. Not required to ship.

> **? License file** — Satoshi is under the ITF Free Font License (free for commercial use and bundling). Consider committing the license text alongside the font, as is good practice for redistributed fonts.
